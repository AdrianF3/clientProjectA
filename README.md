# Client Project - Adrian Fregoso

## Description
<p>
    Hello, this repo is the code I created while working for a client, DismantleYourDoubt.com.<br><br>

</p>

## Demo Info 
<p>
    <b>The demo is still active as it was when I was developing this project</b>. Unfortunately the project/event was cancelled prior to launch and that is when development stopped and I gave up access to the website & backend, as well as the originally deployed repo. I do have a copy of the repo, in its final version.

    Becase of the changes, the demo is no longer interactive - however all of the pages are still visible and can be viewed with default/placeholder information. Below I've listed the workflow users would have experienced with a brief description of each page:

## Demo Walkthrough
- Home Page: <a href="http://DismantleYourDoubt.com" targer="_blank">DismantleYourDoubt.com</a> , users would have been able to learn about the event and purchase access using a Shopify link<br>

- After purhcase on Shopify, a Shopify Webhook would then connect to the backend of the website and save the customers email and firstname to the databse in order to use as log in credentials<br>

- Once the relevant info was saved, a script would then automatically email the customer from DismantleYourDoubt.com, inviting them to complete their registration for the event. 

- Log in: <a href="http://DismantleYourDoubt.com/login.php" targer="_blank">DismantleYourDoubt.com/login.php</a> - customers would be directed to log in using their first name and email address used for their Shopify purchase<br>

- Register: <a href="http://dismantleyourdoubt.com/register.php" targer="_blank">DismantleYourDoubt.com/register.php/</a> - users would be prompted to answer the questions to 'register' for the event, this is also where users would be able to see the Zoom event info<br>

- Registered: <a href="http://dismantleyourdoubt.com/registered.php" targer="_blank">http://dismantleyourdoubt.com/registered.php</a> - After answering the registration questions, users would once again see the Zoom event info<br>

- I built a rudimentary 'Admin View' where the event organizers would be able to view all of the submitted responses at
